# Movie Review Sentiment Analysis

The goal is to build a binary classification model to predict the sentiment of a review with a vocabulary size less than or equal to 1000. A phrase, for example, “worst_movie”, is counted as one word.
You should use the same vocabulary for all five training/test data sets.
Evaluation metric is AUC on the test data. You should try to produce AUC equal to or bigger than 0.96 over all five test data.
